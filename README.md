# face-recognition-brain

I developed a comprehensive full-stack application that harnesses the power of
the Clarifai API to detect faces from user-provided image URLs. The app features
a robust user authentication system, utilizing PostgreSQL to handle registration
and sign-in processes, where user credentials are securely stored with hashed
passwords using bcrypt. This project showcases seamless integration of face
detection technology with secure user management in a user-friendly interface.
